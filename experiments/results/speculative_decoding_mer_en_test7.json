In the audio, however, as time goes on, his voice becomes louder and faster, appearing more excited. This sentence may indicate the male character expressing dissatisfaction and impatience. Audio clue of his raised voice and faster speech, we can infer that he is expressing a sense of dissatisfaction. The wording in this sentence also suggests his dissatisfaction with the other person's actions or remarks, and implies that he may take some action to resolve the issue.",
