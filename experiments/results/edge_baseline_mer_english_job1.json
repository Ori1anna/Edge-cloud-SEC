It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry. When he speaks, his mouth opens wide, accompanied by a frowning motion, indicating that he is engaged in a heated argument with the other person. In the audio, the character's voice is very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, suggesting that the character is very excited and angry. This sentence may be a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang. At the same time, the audio clue describes the character's voice as very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, indicating that the character is very excited and angry.

Subsequently, her direct gaze and slight movement of the lips indicate that she is expressing certain opinions or feelings. Finally, her downward gaze suggests that she is contemplating something. Combining the audio clues of the character's increased speech speed, shorter pauses between sentences, and the character's display of excitement, we can infer that this sentence is likely a reproach or questioning from the female character to the male character, expressing her dissatisfaction or lack of understanding towards him.",
