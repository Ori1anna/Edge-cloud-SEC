Audio clue, we can infer that the female character's emotional state is low or depressed. She then mentions \"Will you accompany me to eat at a street stall tonight?\", which may be her attempt to improve her mood by going out to eat with a friend. Therefore, despite displaying negative emotions, she is still trying to alleviate them through interaction with a friend.",
