The specific emotional state needs to be combined with additional contextual information. Her mouth is moving, and she is looking directly at the other person, indicating that she is engaged in a relatively relaxed and pleasant conversation with the other person. In the audio, the tone of the character is positive, the voice is strong, and certain words are emphasized. Combined with the content of the text, there is an emphasis on the other person's excellence and comforting behavior. This sentence is likely said by the lady on the right to the lady on the left.

At the beginning of the voiceover, there is a slightly mocking tone, combined with the text content \"Look at you, scared like that, over such a small injury,\" it seems that the character is mocking the other person for being overly alarmed. However, this kind of mockery is not meant to be sarcastic or mocking, but rather to comfort the other person and reassure them. This sentence may be a comment or reaction from the right lady to the left lady. Audio clues, as well as the smile and happy emotions displayed by the right lady in the video, we can infer that this sentence is the right lady comforting the left lady and mocking her excessive worry about a minor injury. Therefore, this sentence has a comforting and humorous tone, consistent with the overall positive emotions displayed by the right lady.",
