She points at the other person with a pen, which is often accompanied by the female character's accusation towards the other person. In the final scene, the female character leans forward, and the veins on her neck become more prominent, seemingly emphasizing her tone further. Her mouth is wide open, indicating an intense argument. In the audio, the character speaks at a fast pace. There is a long pause between \"不是\" (no) and \"你跟他干什么呀你\" (what are you doing with him), suggesting that the character made a difficult decision before asking the following question, or it could be due to the character's emotional excitement causing stuttering. (No, what are you doing with him, what do you want to talk to him about). This sentence may be the female character's questioning or accusation towards another person. Additionally, based on the audio clue of the character speaking at a fast pace and the long pause between \"不是\" and \"你跟他干什么呀你,\" we can speculate that the female character may have gone through a period of inner struggle or emotional excitement in this sentence.
