In the following scenes, he puts his hands down and closes his mouth, seemingly waiting for the audience's reaction. In the audio, the character speaks with a stutter, which usually expresses feelings of nervousness, anxiety, or unease, and needs to be analyzed in specific contexts. The character speaks at a fast pace, appearing quite excited. Based on the content, it can be inferred that the character's emotional state is dissatisfaction or anger. Evidence for this inference includes: 1. The repeated use of \"I\" indicates that the character emphasizes his own position and feelings when expressing his opinions and emotions. 2. The use of the phrase \"strongly disagree\" indicates that the character has a strong dissatisfaction or disagreement with the use of \"talent\". 3. Audio clues, we can infer that the man emphasizes his own position and feelings when expressing his opinions and emotions, possibly due to a strong dissatisfaction or disagreement with the use of \"talent\". The phrase \"you know\" in the last sentence may be a way of implying or expecting the other person to understand and resonate, implying the importance of the issue to the man and his emotional investment.",

Her gaze is directly focused on the male, suggesting that she may be directly communicating with him. However, the male's gaze is downward, seemingly trying to avoid communication with the woman. This situation often implies that the woman is accusing the man, and this discussion may not be pleasant. Overall, a tense atmosphere can be felt, indicating that there may be differences or disputes between the two characters, and the woman's emotional state may be irritated and angry.In the audio, the character speaks at a fast pace and with a loud volume. At the same time, the audio clue of the character speaking at a fast pace and with a loud volume, along with the accusatory meaning of the beginning \"哎,\" further supports the woman's angry emotions. Therefore, this sentence expresses the woman's dissatisfaction and anger towards the man's excessive interference in her behavior.",

It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry. When he speaks, his mouth opens wide, accompanied by a frowning motion, indicating that he is engaged in a heated argument with the other person. In the audio, the character's voice is very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, suggesting that the character is very excited and angry. This sentence may be a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang. At the same time, the audio clue describes the character's voice as very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, indicating that the character is very excited and angry.

Audio, the character's speech speed increases, with shorter pauses between sentences, and the character displays more excitement.in the text, the subtitle reads: \"you have nothing to hide, so why are you making a fuss? Why such a big reaction when you have nothing to hide?\" This sentence is likely spoken by the female character to the male character in front of her. Subsequently, her direct gaze and slight movement of the lips indicate that she is expressing certain opinions or feelings. Finally, her downward gaze suggests that she is contemplating something. Combining the audio clues of the character's increased speech speed, shorter pauses between sentences, and the character's display of excitement, we can infer that this sentence is likely a reproach or questioning from the female character to the male character, expressing her dissatisfaction or lack of understanding towards him.",
