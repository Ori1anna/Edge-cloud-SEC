At the same time, the tone word \"啊\" in the audio clue also gives a feeling of questioning the other person.

It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry. When he speaks, his mouth opens wide, accompanied by a frowning motion, indicating that he is engaged in a heated argument with the other person. In the audio, the character's voice is very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, suggesting that the character is very excited and angry. This sentence may be a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang. At the same time, the audio clue describes the character's voice as very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, indicating that the character is very excited and angry. Therefore, it can be inferred that this sentence is a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang in a state of anger.",

She covers her ears, refusing to listen to others, which behavior usually indicates emotional discomfort or stress. At the same time, she lowers her head, continuing to cover her ears, seemingly avoiding eye contact and listening to others. In the audio, the volume is high, and the voice sounds tearful. Combined with the text content, it feels like the character's emotions are extremely broken. This sentence may be what the little girl says to the people around her. At the same time, the description of the audio clue with a tearful voice further supports this inference. Therefore, this sentence can be understood as the little girl requesting others to stop talking because she cannot handle any more emotional stimulation.",

There's also an element of urgency or desperation, as if they're trying really hard not to say something. So I'd guess their emotion is likely anger. What do you think?
