This suggests that he may be dealing with a difficult or unsettling medical situation. In the audio, the voice is deep and the tone is heavy. There is a long pause between \"tomorrow\" and \"surgery is about to happen,\" indicating that the character is struggling to inform the other person about the upcoming surgery.

At the same time, her mouth is moving, and during the conversation, her gaze starts by looking down, then moves left and right, never looking at the male character behind her. It seems that she is engaged in a conversation that she doesn't want to pay attention to and is quite serious. In the audio, the tone of the character is serious. Additionally, there is a sound of a bottle cap still on the table in the voice, suggesting that the character is expressing dissatisfaction and anger through the act of stilling the bottle cap. This sentence is likely spoken by the female character to the male character. Audio clues, it can be inferred that the female character is expressing dissatisfaction and anger in this conversation. Therefore, this sentence expresses the female character's refusal and dissatisfaction towards the male character.",

While speaking, she leans forward, seemingly emphasizing her point of view or opinion. In the audio, the character speaks quickly with a questioning tone, conveying a sense of excitement.

At the same time, she lowers her head, continuing to cover her ears, seemingly avoiding eye contact and listening to others. In the audio, the volume is high, and the voice sounds tearful. Combined with the text content, it feels like the character's emotions are extremely broken. This sentence may be what the little girl says to the people around her. At the same time, the description of the audio clue with a tearful voice further supports this inference. Therefore, this sentence can be understood as the little girl requesting others to stop talking because she cannot handle any more emotional stimulation.",
