Her eyebrows are slightly furrowed and the corners of her mouth are slightly downturned, which may indicate her dissatisfaction or confusion with the current situation. This may indicate that she is somewhat angry. In the audio, the tone word \"啊\" at the end of the speech gives a feeling of questioning the other person. (There's nothing to say, what kind of flowers did you buy for me, huh? You must have something on your mind.) This sentence may be a kind of questioning or accusation from the lady towards the person next to her. Based on the lady's expressions of confusion and displeasure shown in the video clues, as well as the final expression of anger, we can deduce that this sentence carries a tone of dissatisfaction or anger. At the same time, the tone word \"啊\" in the audio clue also gives a feeling of questioning the other person. Therefore, this sentence may be the lady's way of expressing dissatisfaction or accusation towards the person next to her, which aligns with the overall emotional fluctuations displayed by the lady.",

It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry. When he speaks, his mouth opens wide, accompanied by a frowning motion, indicating that he is engaged in a heated argument with the other person. In the audio, the character's voice is very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, suggesting that the character is very excited and angry. This sentence may be a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang. At the same time, the audio clue describes the character's voice as very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, indicating that the character is very excited and angry.

She points at the other person with a pen, which is often accompanied by the female character's accusation towards the other person. In the final scene, the female character leans forward, and the veins on her neck become more prominent, seemingly emphasizing her tone further. Her mouth is wide open, indicating an intense argument. In the audio, the character speaks at a fast pace. There is a long pause between \"不是\" (no) and \"你跟他干什么呀你\" (what are you doing with him), suggesting that the character made a difficult decision before asking the following question, or it could be due to the character's emotional excitement causing stuttering. (No, what are you doing with him, what do you want to talk to him about). This sentence may be the female character's questioning or accusation towards another person. Additionally, based on the audio clue of the character speaking at a fast pace and the long pause between \"不是\" and \"你跟他干什么呀你,\" we can speculate that the female character may have gone through a period of inner struggle or emotional excitement in this sentence. Audio clues, we can infer that this sentence expresses the female character's dissatisfaction and questioning towards the other person's actions, with a certain level of emotional intensity.",
