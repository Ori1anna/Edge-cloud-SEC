The woman on the left and the man on the right both have one hand pressing on the shoulder of the man in the middle, and their other hand is holding onto his arms. It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry. When he speaks, his mouth opens wide, accompanied by a frowning motion, indicating that he is engaged in a heated argument with the other person. In the audio, the character's voice is very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, suggesting that the character is very excited and angry. This sentence may be a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang. At the same time, the audio clue describes the character's voice as very loud, as if shouting with all his strength, indicating that the character is very excited and angry. Therefore, it can be inferred that this sentence is a threat or warning from the man in the middle to Cao Xiaoqiang in a state of anger.",

In the audio, the tone of the character is positive, the voice is strong, and certain words are emphasized. Combined with the content of the text, there is an emphasis on the other person's excellence and comforting behavior. This sentence is likely said by the lady on the right to the lady on the left.

At the beginning of the voiceover, there is a slightly mocking tone, combined with the text content \"Look at you, scared like that, over such a small injury,\" it seems that the character is mocking the other person for being overly alarmed.

Audio clues, as well as the smile and happy emotions displayed by the right lady in the video, we can infer that this sentence is the right lady comforting the left lady and mocking her excessive worry about a minor injury.
