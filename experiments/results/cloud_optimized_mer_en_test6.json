It can be seen that the man in the middle may be somewhat excited and needs to be controlled by these two people through this behavior. We mainly analyze the emotional state of the man in the middle. During the conversation, his mouth opens very wide, accompanied by a forward movement of the head, indicating that he is speaking with great force and is very excited and angry.
